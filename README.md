## Overview
Welcome to the AL Language extension for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.

NOTE: To deploy code built using this extension you need to sign up for a [Dynamics 365 Business Central Sandbox tenant](https://aka.ms/getsandboxforbusinesscentral)

This extension includes:

- Editing support through IntelliSense (Ctrl+Space), syntax highlighting, and formatting

- Using Ctrl+F5 to deploy to the current development instance and using F5 to deploy and debug
- Ability to define a dependency on another extension by listing it in the app.json configuration file
- Autogeneration of app.json and launch.json project files

### Telemetry
The AL Language extension collects telemetry data, which is used to help understand how to improve the product. For example, this data helps to debug issues, such as compiler crashes, slow compilation times, and to prioritize new features.

The extension respects the Visual Studio Code setting for [telemetry reporting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/telemetry). While we appreciate the insights this data provides, we also know that not everyone wants to send usage data and you can disable telemetry as described in [disable telemetry reporting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/telemetry#_disable-telemetry-reporting).
